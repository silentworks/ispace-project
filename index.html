    <p>My body is two babies in – or is that out? – and that there is evidence of what it has done seems inevitable and right. My tummy is soft and pouchy; the perfect resting place for a toddler’s head. My breasts have completed a four-year breastfeeding marathon and are a tad lopsided. I have a C-section scar. My belly button is more like a buttonhole. All of this I see daily but, unless campaigns such as this dare to tell the humdrum truth, I rarely see it beyond the boundaries of my own body. Next step? Maybe we can move on from branding it “honest”, and just call it what it is. Bodies, post-birth.</p>
